# Cyclistic-bike-share-data-analysis

## Welcome to the Cyclitic bike-share analysis!

In this analysis we work for a fictional bike share company and our goal as a data analyst is to find how the casual members are different from annual members which in turn helps to acheive our business goal of converting casual members to annual members. 

I have used R for data cleaning, processing, analyzing and have used the R libraries for data visualization in order to get meaningful insights from the data.
