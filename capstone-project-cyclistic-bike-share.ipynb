Cyclistic sets itself\napart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with\ndisabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.\n\n● Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns\nand initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.\n\n● Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and\nreporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy\nlearning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic\nachieve them.\n\n● Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the\nrecommended marketing program.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**ABOUT THE COMPANY**\n\nIn 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.\n\nUntil now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.\nOne approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\n\nCyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the\npricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.\n\nMoreno has set a clear goal: **Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members**. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand *how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.* Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **ASK**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Guiding questions**\n\n● What is the problem you are trying to solve?\nWe are trying to analyze how annual mebers are different from casual members.\n\n● How can your insights drive business decisions?\nMy insights will help the marketing team to derive startegies that will help the company to convert casual members to annual members.\n\n**Business task** : How are casual and annual members different?\n\n**Stakeholdres** : Lily Moreno and Cyclistic marketing analytics team.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **PREPARE**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Guiding questions**\n\n● Where is your data located?
